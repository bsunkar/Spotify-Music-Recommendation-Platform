Hello everyone! Today, I’m excited to walk you through how we can secure healthcare and member documents seamlessly during claim processing, billing workflows, or any health‑insurance‑related platform.
In many scenarios, documents such as claims, lab reports, or member records are downloaded for downstream or upstream processing. However, this creates a risk of exposing PHI/PII. To address this, we built a solution that can be plugged into any interface or claims platform to automatically secure sensitive information before documents leave the system.
Our core motto for this MVP is simple: ➡️ Ensure healthcare data stays protected whenever someone downloads or takes documents offline.
Today, I’ll show you how our redaction engine helps enforce PHI/PII protection in real time.

🚀 Let’s Begin the Demo
This MVP demonstrates how we secure documents when users attempt to print or download them. We’ve implemented role-based access control (RBAC) with two distinct roles:

🔒 1. Restricted Users
A restricted user can:
* View original documents inside the platform
* But cannot download PHI/PII
When they attempt to download:
* The system automatically redacts PHI/PII
* Then downloads the sanitized version only
Let me log in as a restricted user…
You can see the label here: Restricted Access — originals viewable, downloads are redacted for security.
On the left, we have sample documents containing member‑level information. When I click Download… You’ll notice the system shows “Redacting and Downloading…”
Once downloaded, the file opens with all sensitive member details redacted. That’s exactly how restricted mode protects data from exposure.

🔓 2. Unrestricted Users
Now, let me sign out and log in as an unrestricted user.
Unrestricted access means:
* PHI/PII is automatically redacted even for viewing
* And of course, downloads are also redacted
As soon as I log in, you’ll see that the documents start loading with redaction applied. There’s a brief buffering time as the system sanitizes content.
Once loaded, you can clearly see that all member information is masked, even before interacting with the document.
If I download the file, the same redaction is applied—protecting the data at every step.

⚙️ Scalability & Integration
This platform—called SHIELD—is designed to secure healthcare documents with enterprise‑grade reliability.
Key highlights:
* Works with single‑page or multi‑page documents
* Handles hundreds of pages efficiently
* Built with scalable backend processing
* Can be integrated as a wrapper into any existing interface or platform
* Consistently protects documents used for downstream or upstream operations

🎯 Conclusion
Thank you, everyone, for joining this demo. With this MVP, we’ve demonstrated a powerful mechanism to secure healthcare documentation through automated redaction, ensuring member data stays protected—no matter who downloads it or from which system.
Thank you!
